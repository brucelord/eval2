For this evaluation, I chose to evaluate the <a href="https://lib.ncsu.edu/" alt="North Carolina State University library website"  target="_blank"> North Carolina State University library website.</a> To conduct this evaluation, I will use Garrett&#39s five planes of User Experience Design (surface, skeleton, structure, scope, and strategy). After studying these five planes, it is my opinion that NCSU&#39s library website is a good website that adheres to the five planes of User Experience Design.
</p>
<p>
Garrett recommends that the five planes are used in the following order:
<ol>
	  <li>Strategy</li>
  	<li>Scope</li>
  	<li>Structure</li>
  	<li>Skeleton</li>
  	<li>Surface</li>
</ol>
This evaluation will adhere to that order. First, we will look at the strategy of the website. As discussed in previous evaluations, library websites are intended to help users locate resources. The strategy of NCSU library’s website is clear and there are plenty of links to help users locate resources. For example, right on the homepage there are links to course reserve materials, reserving a study room, and borrowing technology; these are three things that are highly sought by university library user, particularly students. Further examples of the strategy of this website are direct links on the homepage to the database list, journal titles, and a citation builder. As shown below.

<p>
Next, we move onto the scope of the website.
</p>
<p>
In this case, the scope and strategy are closely related. The scope of this website is to help users locate and use library resources. The features and functions of this website help guide users to their desire resources. This is illustrated by the aforementioned links directly on the homepage, in addition to the helpful headings on the homepage which when hovered over display a list of links to various resources. For users interested in library news and events, there are links to those as well right on the homepage. Next, we look at the structure of this website.
</p>
<p>
This website is clearly structured using WordPress. This is evident in the use of different colored ribbons as you scroll down. The website is designed to be both desktop and mobile device friendly, and it succeeds in that regard. The homepage of this site does not require a lot of scrolling, which can be helpful to users. However, as the user scrolls down they will get more detailed items related to the webpage. The headings mentioned earlier are part of the structure as well. These headings were determined by library staff in order to be the most helpful in guiding the user to their desired resource. Now we will evaluate the skeleton of this website.
</p>
<p>
As mentioned before, this website is structured using WordPress, which makes for a pretty user-friendly website. Upon further examination, we&#39re able to see that this website&#39s skeleton was designed to be very efficient, as well as user-friendly. This is evidenced right from when you land on the homepage. The search bar is essentially right in front of the user&#39s sight. These search bars are highly utilized in libraries, especially academic libraries where both broad and in-depth research are conducted. The user&#39s attention is also caught by the moving slide show to the right of the search bar; this not only helps the user notice the search bar, it also highlights various news and events within the library. As mentioned previously, other helpful links and menu headings are focused around the search bar which allows the user to efficiently navigate the site without having to perform a lot of scrolling or searching. This can be seen in the screenshot below.

<p>
Lastly, we will evaluate the surface plane.
</p>
<p>
The evaluation of the other four planes culminates in this fifth plane. To me, elements from the four other planes comprise the surface plane. There are images and text that the user is able to click on to perform some sort of task. This is evidenced by the moving slideshow, pictures to advertise upcoming events, and helpful direct links to course reserve materials, among other things. However, one surface component that is missing is an image that isn’t clickable. All the images on NCSU&#39s library website are clickable and lead to some other page. The NCSU logo for example takes the user to NCSU&#39s homepage. Regardless, the surface of this website is very clean and polished and is a very user-friendly website.
