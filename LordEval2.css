<p>This essay will evaluate and discuss the components of the <a href="https://library.ecu.edu/" alt="East Carolina University library site"  target="_blank"> East Carolina University library site.</a> In addition to the components of this website, this essay will also discuss the tasks that this website was created to facilitate and how the components of this site help accomplish those tasks. 
</p>
<p>
The ECU library website has the following components:
<ol>
	<li>Navigation</li>
	<li>Web hosting</li>
	<li>Call-to-Actions</li>
	<li>Headline</li>
	<li>About Us</li>
	<li>Content</li>
	<li>Visuals</li>
	<li>Mobile friendliness</li>
</ol>
All of these components are evident when you visit the library's website. Navigation is made easy with headings at the top, as well as quick links below the search bar. One item to note is the headings at the top do not have a drop down function when you hover over them with the mouse. This may be something the website designers might want to change because it could improve usability. The heading names could also be clearer (ie: "find resources" and "our services" can be confusing). Since this library website is part of an academic institution, web hosting is fulfilled because this site is hosted on high functioning servers and backup files in the cloud to ensure a high quality website. Similar to most library websites, there are many call-to-action functions. Right on the home page there is a chat with a librarian function, links to social media platforms, and a linkable phone number at the bottom which when clicked on will call the circulation desk at the library. The headline makes it clear to the user that they are on an ECU site, and the site is Joyner Library. This is evidenced by the ECU banner and Joyner Library name right below that. There is a clearly labeled "About Us" section, which as mentioned earlier does not, unfortunately, have a drop down menu when hovered over. However, when clicked on that title takes you to a very information page that contains links to how to plan a visit to the library, departmental listings, an alphabetical staff listing, and a liaison librarian listing, among other things. There is plenty of content right on the homepage. A rolling banner page right below the heading with photos and links to recent news about the library and other useful information. Right below that is the one search bar which allows the user to search all of the library's resources, not just the physical collection. Below that are useful quick links to the library catalog, database list, Google scholar, eResources, and new titles. Below that are more quick links to reserve a study room, ask a librarian, logging into your library account, and an equipment listing; this just names a few of those links.

As the user scrolls down the page there is more useful content such as links to libraries and collections within the main library, such as the music library and teaching resources center. Visuals are an important component to any website because it helps breed user engagement. Visuals are abound on this site as there are plenty of pictures with links to stories about those pictures, as well as pictures that represent libraries and collections within the main library which link to those specific sites. Another engaging visual are the icons next to the links to reserve a study room and borrowing equipment; this helps make the website more engaging as well as accesible because the icons could help users with visual impairments. This is clearly a WordPress website, and WordPress is designed to be mobile friendly. This website is no exception to that as it is very easy to access and scroll through the website.

Library websites are created to help users find and access resources. ECU's library website is no exception to this. As discussed earlier, the website is very engaging and while there are some aspects that could be changed or improved, it is overall an easy site to use. The navigational aspects of this website as discussed earlier make this website easy to navigate. The call-to-actions help encourage user engagement, as well as provides the user more ways to find the resources they need. The content and visuals also make the website engaging and help the user find resources by utilizing photos and icons with links to resources they represent. The mobile friendliness of this site also helps engage users who may be accessing the site from their phone or tablet in order to find the resources they need.
